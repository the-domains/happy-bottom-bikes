            <title><![CDATA[The Cross CurrentJuiced Riders is well known for creating solid and reliable utility 
e-bikes used as true car replacement vehicles. The ODK series of Utility
 e-bikes have dominated the segment and now our new Cross Current sets 
the benchmark in the sporty, high speed e-bike category. The platform is designed on a fundamentally sound 700c aluminum 
bicycle frame with an integrated down tube battery pack. Every part is 
carefully designed, engineered and manufactured to the "Juiced" 
standard. Sporty PerformanceThe Cross-Currentis all about sporty performance. We have designed the bike for maximum performance, minimum weight, and an affordable price. Speed Pedelec: 28mph Top SpeedIt all starts with the new classification of e-bikes. While 
traditional e-bikes are limited to 20mph, Speed Pedelecs or S-pedelecs 
can go up to 28mph using pedal torque-sensing technology. Intuitive Control SystemWith this type of e-bike, there is no twist throttle. The bike uses a
 torque sensor to measure the rider's exact pedal effort 1000 times a 
second and deliver proportional motor assistance up to 28mph. The 
sensation is incredible. Your every stroke is amplified unlike any 
vehicle you have ever ridden.Street-LegalThis type of e-bike is street legal and can be used on bike paths and
 bike lanes. Additionally no license, insurance or registration is 
needed as it is not considered a "motor vehicle" by law. ]]></title>
