The Juiced Rider is the most
functional, reliable and exciting electric cargo bike available anywhere in the
world.

A "Standard Range" 15Ah version provides a real world 40 to 50 miles riding and is the most affordable entry to the world of utility/cargo e-bikes.

The 23Ah "Long Range" version pushes the assisted riding distance out to 60 to 75 miles and farther than any other competitor on the market.

The revolutionary "Super Long Range" 32Ah version pushes the limits of e-bike battery technology providing over 100 miles of assisted riding range with 1,536 Watt-Hours. The pack has 4x more capacity than an average e-bike battery and even more than a Toyota Prius! 

Our high-capacity battery and aluminum low-step cargo frame is the core of the ODK utility platform. We worked hard to retain 100% conformity to bicycle standards and the mechanical parts can be serviced at any bicycle shop. The electrical components are modular and very easy to service.

Rather than installing poorly performing off-the-shelf electric drive kits, we have invested 5 years developing our own system that can go far beyond the limitations of standard e-bike technology. Our custom battery pack and specially tuned electronics are integrated perfectly to create the ultimate car replacement e-bike. 

By sourcing the components directly and doing the integration in-house, we have full control of the platform and can work with our suppliers to achieve the highest value end product.
