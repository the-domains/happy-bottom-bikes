# **The Cross Current**

Juiced Riders is well known for creating solid and reliable utility 
e-bikes used as true car replacement vehicles. The ODK series of Utility
e-bikes have dominated the segment and now our new Cross Current sets 
the benchmark in the sporty, high speed e-bike category. 

The platform is designed on a fundamentally sound 700c aluminum 
bicycle frame with an integrated down tube battery pack. Every part is 
carefully designed, engineered and manufactured to the "Juiced" 
standard.

# **Sporty Performance**

[**The Cross-Current**][0]is all about sporty performance. We have designed the bike for maximum performance, minimum weight, and an affordable price. 

# **Speed Pedelec: 28mph Top Speed**

It all starts with the new classification of e-bikes. While 
traditional e-bikes are limited to 20mph, Speed Pedelecs or S-pedelecs 
can go up to 28mph using pedal torque-sensing technology. 

# **Intuitive Control System**

With this type of e-bike, there is no twist throttle. The bike uses a
torque sensor to measure the rider's exact pedal effort 1000 times a 
second and deliver proportional motor assistance up to 28mph. The 
sensation is incredible. Your every stroke is amplified unlike any 
vehicle you have ever ridden.

# **Street-Legal**

This type of e-bike is street legal and can be used on bike paths and
bike lanes. Additionally no license, insurance or registration is 
needed as it is not considered a "motor vehicle" by law.
